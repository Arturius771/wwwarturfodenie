The NoSQL portion of the module focused on document databases with the appropriate data analysis techniques, as well as scaling the databases (replication/sharding/distributed transactions). The module concluded with data warehousing, data mining, and linked semantic web dataset interactions (eg. OWL and RDF languages).",
